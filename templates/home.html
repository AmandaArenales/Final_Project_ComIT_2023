                <p> Real Canadian Superstore is a chain of supermarkets owned by Canadian food retailing giant 
                    Loblaw Companies. Originating in Western Canada in the late 1970s/early 1980s, the banner 
                    expanded into Ontario in the early 2000s. Loblaw has tested alternative banners at some 
                    locations in Ontario, with some labelled as 
                    "Loblaw Superstore", and a few others as simply "Superstore".</p>

                <p>Walmart has been changing the face of retail since the first store opened
                in 1962. They have continued to pursue ways to bring technology into retail to offer 
                customers a seamless shopping experience. You can find a ton of items in a Walmart 
                store, but as customers increasingly shop across digital and physical storefronts, 
                they have made it easier for you to find what you need right at your fingertips.</p>
