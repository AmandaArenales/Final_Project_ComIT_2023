# Final Project - Web Application

This project marks the end of the ComIT Web Development with Python course, where I successfully leveraged a combination of Django, HTML, and CSS to create a dynamic and visually appealing web application.

## Description

The project is a web application developed as my capstone project. I used the Django framework for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. The application allows users to register as either customers or vendors. As a user, you can search for products and check which supermarket offers the best price. As a vendor, you can register your products. The goal is to enable consumers to find the place offering the cheapest products. This way, the customer will know in advance where to go to save money. The website will display the price of the selected product according to the groceries stores that have it, making it easier for users to find the best deals.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can sign up as either customers or vendors.
- **Product Search:** Search for products within the application.
- **Price Comparison:** View prices of a specific product across multiple supermarkets.
- **Vendor Product Registration:** Vendors can register their products on the platform.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication system to protect user accounts.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for a seamless user experience.
- **Data Management:** Efficient management of product data and user information.
- **Search Filters:** Refine product search results based on user preferences.
- **Admin Panel:** Backend interface for administrators to manage users, products, vendors.
